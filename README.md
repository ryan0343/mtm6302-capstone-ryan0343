All SVG Icons are modified and obtained from svgrepo.com

Report:
The first thing I did was create the main pages I would be working for the course of the project, that being index.html and style.css. The next step was ensuring all my links would be properly connected.

After that, I set up most of the variables and files I knew I would need.

Unfortunately, this is where I made a mistake, leaving things roughly to the last minute on this project.

I did as much as I could within the past few days, mainly focusing on getting the index and navigation working as well as I could during that time. The only major touchstones I have left are creating the settings page and adding the background 'bubbles' featured in the mockup.

Beyond JS functionality, these are a few additional goals I have for part 4 of this project:
    - Touch up some minor alignment issues, mainly within the final buttons of each mainCard.
    - Touch up some visuals, add further supporting elements from the mockup (button 'shadows' and background 'bubbles').
    - Design and finish a simple settings menu for the user with the following functionality:
        - ability to change profile picture.
        - ability to delete and set profile picture to default.
        - ability to change username.
        - ability to change password.
        - ability to log out (doesn't hurt to have an additional link here).
        - ability to delete account.
    - If time, include an original concept: the ability to randomly select and display from one of a few palettes on each page refresh or entrance. These palettes are already created, it's just incorporating them into the project will be an additional challenge.

I struggled with the following things during development of this project:
    - Applying the correct hover states to buttons. Eventually, I found better ways to call what I was looking for, and able to override some defaults found in Bootstrap.
    - Sizing of the favourites .svg; for whatever reason, neither resizing it in the svg file nor setting a width for the container would work. I eventually found a version that worked properly in the container.
    - Some mobile alignment of items within the previous games section.
    - Hiding one version of the navigation when signed in/out.
    - Had difficulty in layering svg items in the background.
    - Gutters would not work within the Question Card for the longest time, until I ended up realizing that I had been applying the gutters to the wrong parent. ;n;

This project could have been more complete and feature-rich had I not left things to the last few days left. This was well within my abilities to complete; for the final, I may begin working almost right away. This is a bad habit in programming that I am gradually shaking.

In any case, have a great day, and good luck marking the rest of these assignments!
