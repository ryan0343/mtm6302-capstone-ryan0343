Report:

This project went much smoother than the last few projects due to spacing out the production over multiple days, as well as having most of the basic structure already laid out for development. I was able to implement a few of the visual features that were missing 

Ran into a few difficulties while coding, thankfully I was able to overcome most of them:
    - Had difficulties with assigning the correct properties to the question buttons, ended up using plenty of if statements within a loop through the buttons to properly assign values and adjust variables meant to track correct and incorrect answers.
    - Issue with repeatable use of certain event listeners, solved by including these in their respective render functions.
    - Issue with question continue button being affected by tags that controlled the question buttons, moved the controlling element for these buttons to the one directly containing them, rather than the entire card itself.
    - removed sign in features for the time being, realized that I have no way of storing that safely at the time being. Sign-in pages and nav menu code are still left in as comments and vestigial code to make future incorporation of those features smoother.

Other than that, things went rather well this time around.

Thank you.
